## Key Features

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Customizable" icon="pencil">
        Equibop comes with [Equicord](https://equicord.org/) out of the box, allowing you to customize your Discord
        experience with many powerful plugins and themes.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Privacy friendly" icon="seti:ignored">
        Equibop is [open source](https://github.com/Equicord/Equibop) and does not include any tracking or telemetry.
        Blocks Discord telemetry out of the box and heavily limits Discord's access to your system.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Lightweight" icon="rocket">
        Equibop is much more lightweight than the official Discord app, possibly leading to better performance
        (depending on your system).
    </Card>
    <Card title="Better Linux experience" icon="linux">
        Equibop is built with Linux in mind. Allows you to stream with system audio.
