## Wayland Support

Equibop runs as an X11 application by default. You can override this behaviour.

-   If you are using Flatpak, open [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) and deny the `X11 windowing system` permission for Equibop.
-   If you are not using Flatpak, you can opt into Wayland by running equibop with the `--ozone-platform-hint=auto` flag. To make this permanent, see [Making Command line flags permanent](#making-command-line-flags-permanent).

## GNOME Tray Icon

To enable the tray icon on GNOME, install the [AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/)

## Making Command Line Flags Permanent

Locate Equibop's `.desktop` file.

```sh
locate -ib equibop.desktop
```

It should usually be in `/usr/share/applications/equibop.desktop`.

Open it with a text editor and add your flags to the `Exec` line, after the binary path and before the `%U` (if it exists).

```
Exec=/usr/bin/equibop --ozone-platform-hint=auto %U
```

## Enable Middle Click Auto Scroll

To enable middle click auto scroll, run Equibop with the `--enable-blink-features=MiddleClickAutoscroll` flag. To make this permanent, see [Making Command line flags permanent](#making-command-line-flags-permanent).

By default, this will conflict with the default Linux behaviour of pasting the clipboard contents when middle clicking. To change this behaviour:

-   If you are running Equibop in X11 (default), install and run [XMousePasteBlock](https://github.com/milaq/XMousePasteBlock).
-   If you are running Equibop in Wayland, you might be able to disable it in your Desktop settings.
    On GNOME, you can disable it in [Gnome Tweaks](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Tweaks).
