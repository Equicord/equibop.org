## Equibop Arguments & Customization

If you need to customize how Equibop runs, you can pass arguments directly via the terminal or through the application settings at `Settings > Equibop Settings > Arguments > Configure`.

### **Wayland Support**

Equibop runs as an X11 application by default. You can override this behaviour.

```bash
--wayland
```

This is a shortcut flag that forces the application to use the **Ozone Wayland** platform. It automatically enables:

* `WaylandWindowDecorations`
* `VaapiVideoDecodeLinuxGL` (Hardware acceleration)
> **Note:** You can still use the manual string:
> `--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland`
### **Security & Performance**

```bash
--no-sandbox
```

Disables the Chromium sandbox. This is generally discouraged for security reasons but is often required when the application is executed as **root**.

```bash
--force_high_performance_gpu
```

Instructs the graphics engine to ignore integrated graphics and prioritize the discrete (high-performance) GPU.

### **Additional Features**

* **Middle Click Auto Scroll:** Run with `--enable-blink-features=MiddleClickAutoscroll`. 
    * *Note:* This conflicts with the Linux "middle click to paste" behavior. To fix this on X11, use [XMousePasteBlock](https://github.com/milaq/XMousePasteBlock). On Wayland/GNOME, disable it via **Gnome Tweaks**.

## GNOME Tray Icon

To enable the tray icon on GNOME, install the [AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/).

## Making Flags Permanent

You can make these arguments persistent using two different methods:

### Method 1: Persistent Configuration File (Recommended)
The launcher supports reading arguments from a specific config file.
* **File Path:** `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/equibop-flags.conf`
* **Usage:** Lines starting with `#` are ignored. Valid entries are automatically appended to the execution command.

### Method 2: Editing the .desktop File
Locate Equibop's `.desktop` file:
```sh
locate -ib equibop.desktop
```

Usually in `/usr/share/applications/equibop.desktop`. Open it and add your flags to the `Exec` line, before the `%U`:

```text
Exec=/usr/bin/equibop --wayland --force_high_performance_gpu %U
```
